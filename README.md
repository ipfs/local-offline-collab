## About

The IPFS Local Offline Collaboration (Locol) Special Interest Group is focused on understanding the challenges of users in offline or async networks, collaborating with partners serving those users, and prototyping solutions to understand how to make IPFS more useful for local offline collaboration.

### Responsibilities include:

- Participate in communities like [Offline First](http://offlinefirst.org/)
- Conduct user research around offline and local-first use cases, communities, and best practices
- Support collaborations between IPFS and community members who are building tools for peer-to-peer sharing and collaboration in local/offline networks
- Research and prototype applications that utilize IPFS for local-first collaboration and resilient offline usage

### Monthly calls:

We meet monthly to discuss projects and share demos relevant to local and offline collaboration. These meetings typically take place on 2nd Wednesday of each month, but timing may vary.
